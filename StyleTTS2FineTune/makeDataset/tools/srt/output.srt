1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,840
Even the Kaslan type, when enlarged, shows great

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,700
shortcomings in this respect.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,740
For where these are boldly and carefully designed,

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,820
and each letter is thoroughly individual in form,

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,540
the due relation of letter to pictures and

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,640
other ornament was thoroughly understood by the old

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,080
printers.

8
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,040
So that of these wards, three were appropriated

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,380
to the cabin side, so called, because the

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,340
king's bench was a national prison, in which

11
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,759
were confined all debtors arrested for debt or

12
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:33,820
for contempt of the court of the king's

13
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:34,180
bench.

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,000
Legacies had also been left to free a

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,160
certain number of debtors, notably that of 100

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,260
pounds per annum.

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,960
There were 15 rooms of various sizes, and

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,960
as the numbers imprisoned rarely exceeded five and

19
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,620
twenty, the place was never overcrowded, issued once

20
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,840
a week, and divided as far as it

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,200
would go, a very precarious and uncertain ration.

22
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,120
And, no doubt, made the meat also pay

23
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:00,520
toll.

24
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,660
Quote, a common-sized man, says the keeper

25
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,740
Mr. Newman, can turn in 19 inches, end

26
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,620
quote, with convicts of all ages and characters,

27
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,540
to render it next to impossible but that,

28
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,120
with the obliteration of all sense of self

29
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,640
-respect, the tried and the untried, young and

30
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,300
old, were herded together.

31
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,880
Few, realizing that the dreadful fate would overtake

32
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,600
them, dismissed the prospect of death.

33
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,680
Unlimited drink was not denied them, provided it

34
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,080
was obtained in regulated quantities at one time,

35
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,700
and their jibes and jollity counteracted the ordinary's

36
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,220
counsels or the independent preacher's earnest prayers.

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,980
The jail was neither suitable nor sufficiently large.

38
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,240
It was not even kept weather-tight, except

39
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,840
for the use of the debtors or as

40
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,040
medical comforts for the infirmary.

41
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,480
All the committee could do in this respect

42
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,440
was to throw the responsibility on others.

43
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,520
The onus of improvement lay upon the magistracy,

44
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,640
the local authorities administering local funds, or to

45
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,080
make him sleep in close contact with the

46
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,520
victims of contagious and loathsome disease.

47
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,060
The fatal consequences whereof might be prevented if

48
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,500
the justices of the peace were duly authorized.

49
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,440
In the balance, some work was done, but

50
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,980
with the most meager results.

51
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,800
The old evils of indiscriminate association still continued

52
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,640
unchecked.

53
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,080
Although at Mr. Buxton's visit, a new jail

54
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,740
was in process of erection, the first step

55
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:35,320
towards reform since Howard's visitation in 1774.

56
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,860
Meat was no longer issued raw to be

57
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,900
imperfectly cooked before a ward fire and bolted

58
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,760
gluttonously, the whole two pounds at one sitting.

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,740
They used their own tools, and this without

60
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,400
any dangerous consequences as regards facilitating the escape

61
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,060
of others.

62
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,380
Speaking on a debate on prison matters, he

63
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,680
declared that many of them will build new

64
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,060
jails, and that when, in a year or

65
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,960
two, we come to examine their situation, as

66
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,040
is shown by the report of the commissioners

67
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,840
to inquire into the state of the municipal

68
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,180
corporations in 1835.

69
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,760
An examination of this report shows how even

70
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,020
the most insignificant township had its jail, and

71
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,060
as the window frames would not shut tight,

72
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,920
the prisoners complained much of the cold, especially

73
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,340
at night, of more depraved and systematic criminals.

74
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,340
Consign many of the more petty and unpracticed

75
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,780
offenders to this place.

76
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,120
The fact was, he did not keep the

77
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,000
classification of prisoners on first arrival in his

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,460
own hands, nor even in that of his

79
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,020
officers.

80
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,360
Their original capital had been a few shillings,

81
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,840
and for this they purchased the right to

82
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,380
tax their fellows to the extent of pounds

83
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:45,940
per week.

84
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,520
All the wardsmen alike were more or less

85
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,280
irresponsible.

86
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,700
The turnkeys complained bitterly that these old prisoners

87
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,640
had more power than they themselves.

88
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,100
Laughing and uproarious, utterly unmindful of the companionship

89
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,580
of men, upon whom lay the shadow of

90
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,760
an impending, shameful death, these pungent and well

91
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,800
-grounded strictures applied with still greater force to

92
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,620
the unconvicted prisoner, the man who came to

93
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,300
the prison innocent and still uncontaminated.

94
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,920
The sheriff arrived, attended by his officers, to

95
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,600
receive the prisoner from the keeper.

96
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,600
This went on for more than an hour,

97
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,680
and until the malefactors were cut down and

98
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,500
the gallows removed, were blocked by persons who

99
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,960
had overflowed from the area in front of

100
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,480
the jail.

101
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,400
Gin shops and coffeehouses were the first to

102
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,360
open doors, and touts began to bid for

103
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,000
tenants for the various rooms upstairs.

104
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,520
The approaching ceremony had evidently no terrors for

105
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,420
these idolaters of the gallows, or theirs might

106
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,280
be one of many, and it might be

107
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,800
considered necessary to make an example.

108
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,400
This was noticeable with Fauntleroy, who, on account

109
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,360
of his birth and antecedents, was allowed to

110
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,080
occupy a turnkey's room.

111
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,580
The next convict is clearly and unmistakably a

112
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:01,820
villain.

113
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,220
He has, however, doubly earned his sentence, and

114
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,200
is actually condemned for burglary committed since his

115
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,080
arrival in England.

116
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,960
Struggles violently, his feet, legs, hands, and arms,

117
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,600
even the muscles of his back, Mr. Wakefield

118
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,780
winds up his graphic but somewhat sensational account

119
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,900
by describing another religious service, which may appropriately

120
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,060
be inserted here.

121
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,180
Could hardly witness this ceremony without being affected.

122
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,600
The men, who were so lately snatched from

123
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,560
the jaws of death, in spite of the

124
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,760
throng, owing to the excellent arrangements made by

125
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,400
the sheriffs.

126
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,280
In chapter two of the present volume, I

127
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,600
brought down the record of crime to the

128
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,620
second decade of the present century.

129
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,980
Oxford expressed little anxiety or concern.

130
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,020
This letter went on to say that a

131
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,980
new member had been introduced by Lieutenant Mars,

132
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,760
a fine, tall, gentlemanly young man.

133
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,380
The whole of the evidence pointed so strongly

134
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,480
towards insanity that the jury brought in a

135
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,400
verdict of acquittal on that ground.

136
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,860
As I have already said, they took the

137
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,760
chaplain seriously to task for the bad taste

138
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,100
shown in the condemned sermon preached before Fauntleroy.

139
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,040
His defense was that the forged acceptances would

140
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,020
have been met on coming to maturity, and

141
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,540
that he had no real desire to defraud.

142
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,440
Miss Turner, greatly agitated, accompanied the messenger who

143
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,640
had brought this news, a disguised servant of

144
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,440
Wakefield's.

145
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,860
Monsieur Le Maire was appealed to and decided

146
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,820
to leave it to the young lady who

147
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,500
had once abandoned Wakefield.

148
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,720
After their release from Lancaster and Newgate, respectively,

149
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,960
both Wakefields went abroad.

150
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,100
By this time, the neighbors were aroused, and

151
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,040
several people came to the scene of the

152
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,460
affray.

153
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,380
On one occasion, the whole of the proceeds

154
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,240
of a robbery from a boot shop was

155
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,560
traced to Solomon's.

156
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,120
He claimed to be admitted to bail and

157
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,080
was taken from Newgate on a writ of

158
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,800
habeas before one of the judges sitting at

159
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,680
Westminster, one of them of considerable size.

160
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,180
He was reported to have fallen away to

161
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:06,740
a shadow.

162
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,240
Eventually, the law overtook them, but almost by

163
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,720
accident.

164
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,060
Who examined Bishop and his fellows and, further

165
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,180
incriminating evidence adduced, to the effect that the

166
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,800
prisoners had bartered for a coach to carry

167
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,640
a stiffen, the most ghastly part of the

168
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,320
story is that which deals with his getting

169
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,220
rid of the head.

170
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,580
The executors to the estate disputed the validity

171
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,660
of this document.

172
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,160
Barber and Fletcher were both transported for life,

173
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,800
although Fletcher declared that Barber was innocent and

174
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,920
had no guilty knowledge of what was being

175
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,340
done.

176
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,340
Suspicions were aroused when it was found that

177
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,560
he had been employed in selling stock for

178
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,820
Mr. Oxenford, which developed into certainty.

179
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,900
The furniture turned upside down, the drawers of

180
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,920
the escrotoir open and rifled.

181
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,380
Who took a carving knife from the sideboard

182
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,980
in the dining room, went upstairs to Lord

183
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,900
William's bedroom and drew the knife across his

184
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,380
throat.

185
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,380
He lived at Mile End, whence he walked

186
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,980
often to call at three, Minver Place, Bermondsey,

187
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,100
the residence of his old love, which, having

188
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,440
possessed herself of the murdered man's keys, she

189
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,160
rifled from end to end, and at their

190
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,400
request two police officers were sent to Bermondsey

191
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,220
to inquire for him at the Mannings, with

192
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,740
whom it was well known that he was

193
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,400
very intimate.

194
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,620
The stray hand of the firm which came

195
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,460
to grief was a Snow, who changed his

196
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,320
name for a fortune of two hundred thousand

197
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:34,799
pounds.

198
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,780
The bank had been conducted on false principles.

199
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,700
Within a year he was advanced to the

200
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,300
post of chief clerk in the transfer department,

201
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,260
at a salary of one hundred fifty pounds

202
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:46,840
a year.

203
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,260
They drove there, and Robson, on arrival, did

204
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,080
the honors of his house, rang for lunch

205
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,580
to gain time, paid him the compliment of

206
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,260
describing him as a young man of great

207
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,240
intelligence, considerable powers of mind, and possessed of

208
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,880
an education very much beyond the rank of

209
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,240
life to which he originally belonged.

210
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,300
Redpath was called in, and informed of the

211
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,380
intended investigation.

212
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,500
He tried to stave off the evil hour

213
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,940
by declaring that everything was perfectly right, but

214
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,220
Saward's operations were mainly directed to the fabrication

215
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,960
and uttering of forged checks.

216
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,900
Saward's method of negotiating the checks was equally

217
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,780
well planned.

218
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,320
A harrowing scene followed, and then, following her

219
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,280
down a ladder into the house, told his

220
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,740
story, appealed to and won her compassion.

221
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,520
A silver coin bearing the same relation to

222
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,480
the Scottish pound that an English shilling does

223
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,960
to an English pound, was made to pass

224
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,960
current in England.

225
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,420
Often the convicts give way to despair.

226
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,220
They are too closely watched to be allowed

227
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,320
to do themselves much mischief, or suicides would

228
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,680
probably be more frequent.

229
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,780
Wilson was acquitted on this charge, but other

230
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,440
suspicious facts cropped up while she was in

231
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:03,940
Newgate.

232
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,720
The murders were perpetrated on the 10th September,

233
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,740
and the ship continued her voyage for nearly

234
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,320
three weeks, meeting and speaking one ship only,

235
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,840
no soldiers either.

236
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,860
The friends of Mr. Briggs were communicated with,

237
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,800
and it was ascertained that when he left

238
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,160
home the morning of the murderous attack, and

239
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,680
recognized as one of the frequenters of the

240
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,180
bogus law stationers.

241
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,020
His arrest led to that of others.

242
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,460
His disappearance gave color and substance to evil

243
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,120
reports already in circulation, that the will and

244
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,960
conveyance above referred to, and Austin Bidwell opened

245
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,920
a bona fide credit in the Burlington or

246
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,240
West End branch of the Bank of England.

247
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,780
The ground thus cleared, the forgers poured in

248
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,900
from Birmingham numbers of forged acceptances, the bills

249
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,080
were sent as a matter of form to

250
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,020
the drawer, to have the date added, and

251
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,960
the forgery was at once detected, had undoubtedly

252
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,160
the command of large funds while there, and

253
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,560
would have readily dispersed it to effect their

254
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,200
enlargement.

255
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,180
Webster, it may be mentioned here, was one

256
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,980
of the worst prisoners ever remembered in Newgate.

257
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,620
The alternative between labor, or idleness, or the

258
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,340
selection of the form of labor, district prisons

259
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,340
were to be established for this purpose, each

260
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,900
of which would be in the heart of

261
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,660
a farm of a thousand acres.

262
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,260
The old wards, day rooms, and sleeping rooms

263
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,980
combined, of which the reader has already heard

264
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,940
so much, it was less prompt apparently in

265
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,900
dealing with structural alterations and improvements, and abandoned

266
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,420
because of the expense.

267
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,790
As to the reconstruction of Newgate, nothing had

268
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,770
been done as yet.

269
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,450
The proposal made was to purchase some 50

270
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:53,630
,000 square feet between Newgate, Warwick Lane, and

271
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,490
the Sessions House.

272
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,070
Here, the treadwheel was in use.

273
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:01,190
There, cellular cranks, or hard labor machines.

274
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,450
The Secretary of State was empowered to deal

275
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:08,630
rather summarily with inadequate prisons, in other words,

276
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,390
to avail himself of his powers, as it

277
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,830
was difficult to bring home the derelictions of

278
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,750
duties and evasion of the acts.

279
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,610
Too much was left to the inspectors.

280
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,070
As the years passed, great want of uniformity

281
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,950
continued to prevail throughout the prisons of the

282
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:25,750
United Kingdom.

283
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,710
Three years after the advent of the prison

284
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,270
commissioners, it was decided that Newgate was an

285
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:35,250
excessively costly and redundant establishment.

286
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,790
Cut this into round cakes with a biscuit

287
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,170
cutter or a sharp edged tumbler, and fold

288
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,530
not quite in the middle.

289
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,210
Arrange the rolls in regular rows in the

290
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,530
pan about a quarter of an inch apart.

291
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:50,910
Five tablespoons of yeast, yolk of one egg

292
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:51,710
beaten light.

293
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,090
One word with regard to getting up early

294
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,790
in order to give dough a chance for

295
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,730
the second rising.

296
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:00,510
During the last 12 months, our industrial recovery

297
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:04,230
has been, to some extent, retarded by strikes.

298
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,550
I shall seek assurances of the making and

299
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:11,190
maintenance of agreements which can be mutually relied

300
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,670
upon.

301
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,750
The great Chief Justice White said, when one

302
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,530
of these ships is under construction and the

303
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,970
steel frames have been set in the keel,

304
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,950
the overwhelming majority of people in this country

305
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,830
know how to sift the wheat from the

306
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,430
chaff in what they hear and what they

307
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:28,950
read.

308
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:29,470
Six.

309
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,530
Projects will be allocated to localities or relief

310
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,910
areas in relation to the number of workers

311
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:39,210
on relief rolls in those areas, charged with

312
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:42,350
carrying on work relief projects, and of making

313
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,530
certain that people who are employed will be

314
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,310
taken from the relief rolls to move as

315
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:52,210
rapidly as possible back into private employment when

316
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,770
such employment is available.

317
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:58,030
Having in mind that, in succeeding generations, many

318
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:01,590
other problems then undreamed of would become national

319
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,710
problems, to presume in favor of its validity

320
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,930
until its violation of the Constitution is proved

321
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,810
beyond all reasonable doubt.

322
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,730
Has reached the age of 70 and does

323
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,830
not avail himself of the opportunity to retire

324
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,410
on a pension, this plan of mine is

325
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:20,930
no attack on the Court.

326
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:24,030
This proposal of mine will not infringe in

327
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,010
the slightest upon the civil or religious liberties

328
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,150
so dear to every American, but the fact,

329
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:33,870
important as it was, fell into oblivion and

330
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:37,890
had to be rediscovered by Treviranus in 1807.

331
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,650
On the other hand, the definition thus amended

332
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:44,090
will exclude all ordinary vegetable organisms.

333
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:48,970
Amylaceous and saccharine substances are largely manufactured even

334
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,870
by the highest animals, and, which certainly hold

335
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,290
good for the vast majority of animals and

336
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,910
plants, are of universal application.

337
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,990
Energy enters the plant to a small extent,

338
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,290
all organisms have the same need of reproduction.

339
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,670
Such structures or organs are most often found

340
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,310
internally.

341
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:11,070
These, therefore, may well be called backboned animals,

342
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:15,050
exhibit a remarkable series of homologies pointing to

343
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:18,170
a five-toed ancestor, and any other series

344
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,870
of organs of vertebrates would give the same

345
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:24,330
evidence of fundamental resemblances homologies.

346
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,850
You tap gently with your heel upon the

347
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,250
shoulder of the dromedary to urge her on.

348
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,470
I dug its moat to the water level,

349
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,010
a square enclosure, two furlongs each way, with

350
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:38,170
gates of solid brass, which was also remaining

351
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,070
in my time.

352
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,670
He was followed by three kings whose reigns

353
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,250
were short.

354
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,490
He extended his empire to the Mediterranean and

355
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,190
even to Egypt, whether of former or of

356
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,910
later times, except only Cyrus, with whom no

357
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,710
person ever yet thought himself worthy to compare.

358
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,530
When Julian saw this, he caused a large

359
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,990
part of the wall to be overthrown, and

360
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,690
as the beasts escaped, they were shot down

361
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,570
by his soldiers.

362
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,150
In his quaint way, he says, has been

363
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:09,270
removed, and the surrounding city walls have been

364
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:09,710
traced.

365
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,970
This inner part was about 24 feet wide,

366
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:16,970
and at intervals of about 140 feet, it

367
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,490
was surmounted with towers.

368
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,510
A modern artist would have difficulty in doing

369
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,850
such accurate work.

370
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,270
The three agreed that the president would come

371
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,790
to Texas in late November 1963.

372
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:31,550
According to O'Donnell, quote, we had a motorcade

373
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,430
wherever we went, end quote.

374
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,550
They conveyed the pleas of Dallas leaders that

375
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:40,050
citizens not demonstrate or create disturbances during the

376
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,010
president's visit.

377
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,670
Welcome, Mr. Kennedy, to Dallas, sponsored by the

378
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,950
American Fact-Finding Committee, which the sponsor later

379
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,010
testified was an ad hoc committee.

380
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,010
Approximately 10 minutes after the arrival at Love

381
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:56,290
Field, the president and Mrs. Kennedy went to

382
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:59,530
the presidential automobile to begin the motorcade.

383
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,470
The vice presidential car to the intersection of

384
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:05,530
Houston Street, which marks the beginning of Dealey

385
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:05,990
Plaza.

386
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:09,670
Other Secret Service agents assigned to the motorcade

387
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,430
remained at their posts during the race to

388
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,010
the hospital.

389
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,290
The first physician to see the president at

390
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,869
Parkland Hospital was Dr. Charles J.

391
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:20,650
Carrico, a resident in general surgery.

392
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,810
Dr. Carrico noted two wounds, a small bullet

393
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,530
wound in the front lower neck.

394
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:28,290
Dr. Clark, who most closely observed the head

395
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:31,830
wound, according to Klein's shipping order form, one

396
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:36,990
Italian carbine 6.5 X4 X scope.

397
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,070
Oswald's use of the name Hedel to purchase

398
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:43,370
the assassination weapon was one of several instances

399
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,270
in which he used this name as an

400
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,750
alias.

401
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:49,050
Having reviewed the evidence that one, Lee Harvey

402
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,850
Oswald purchased the rifle used in the assassination,

403
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:55,670
the FBI laboratory developed a latent palm print

404
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,970
and latent fingerprint on the bag.

405
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,730
This clipboard had been made by Kaiser and

406
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:01,910
had his name on it.

407
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,650
Brennan's description should also be compared with the

408
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:08,190
eyewitness description broadcast over the Dallas Police Radio

409
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,690
at 1.22 p.m. But the testimony

410
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:14,530
of these employees, together with photographs subsequently taken

411
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,570
of them at the scene of the assassination,

412
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:20,650
when specifically asked before the commission, Ewins, who

413
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,710
was on the southwest corner of Elm and

414
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:26,230
Houston streets, testified that he could not describe

415
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,810
the man he saw in the window.

416
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,870
Just before snapping the picture, Alchins heard a

417
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,110
noise which sounded like the popping of a

418
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,710
firecracker.

419
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,530
As Baker reached the second floor, he was

420
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,610
about 20 feet from the vestibule door.

421
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,470
He intended to continue around to his left

422
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,170
toward the stairway going up.

423
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,770
The second test run required one minute and

424
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:46,690
15 seconds.

425
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:49,250
This is the period during which Oswald would

426
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,530
have descended the stairs.

427
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,710
In all likelihood, they re-entered the building

428
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,430
by the rear door several minutes after Baker

429
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,990
and Truly rushed through the front entrance.

430
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:02,090
Fritz believed that he learned of Oswald's absence

431
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:04,490
after the rifle was found."

432
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:08,390
As Mrs. Bledsoe said these words, she pointed

433
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,610
to her right elbow.

434
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:13,990
About 100 feet past the intersection, Tippett stopped

435
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,550
a man walking east along the south side

436
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,150
of Patton.

437
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,230
He approached the car and apparently exchanged words

438
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,690
with Tippett through the right front or vent

439
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:23,210
window.

440
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,590
He subsequently testified before a commission staff member,

441
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:30,650
and when shown two photographs of Oswald, stated

442
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,810
that they were photographs of the man he

443
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:33,230
saw.

444
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,370
Oswald's jacket.

445
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:35,930
I don't know if this is the man

446
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,130
they want, but he is running from them

447
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,610
for some reason."

448
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,290
She then called the police.

449
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:43,030
Six.

450
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,970
You can either throw out or give my

451
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:46,910
clothing, etc.

452
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:47,530
away.

453
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,170
Do not keep these.

454
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:52,650
The FBI refuses to draw any conclusion as

455
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,530
to probability.

456
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,270
Once you know that, you must put the

457
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,730
crosshairs on the target, and that is all

458
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,690
that is necessary.

459
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:01,490
In fact, one of the firers in the

460
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:04,730
rapid fire test, in firing his two series

461
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:08,430
of three shots, Oswald's marine training in marksmanship,

462
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:13,070
his other rifle experience, and his established familiarity

463
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:16,350
with this particular weapon, the commission agrees with

464
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,650
the testimony of marine marksmanship expert Zahm.

465
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:23,050
The discussion below will describe the events known

466
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:26,130
to the commission, which most clearly reveals the

467
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,770
formation and nature of Oswald's character.

468
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,570
Well, I've got to live with her.

469
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:33,030
I guess I love her, end quote.

470
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,550
An old lady handed me a pamphlet about

471
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,010
saving the Rosenbergs.

472
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,290
I looked at that paper and I still

473
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,570
remember it for some reason.

474
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,430
I don't know why, end quote.

475
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,370
Defection to the Soviet Union, the Warren Commission

476
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:49,130
Report by the President's Commission on the Assassination

477
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,130
of President Kennedy.

478
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:53,270
Chapter seven, Lee Harvey Oswald.

479
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,890
If somebody did that to me, a lousy

480
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,390
trick like that, to take my wife away

481
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,830
and all the furniture, I would be mad

482
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,590
as hell too.

483
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:05,530
On October 9, 1962, he went to the

484
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:08,690
Dallas office of the Texas Employment Commission, who

485
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:12,490
had previously interviewed Oswald, saw him on television,

486
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,010
and heard a radio debate in which he

487
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:18,190
engaged on August 21, 1963.

488
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,870
Leaving the note and picture as he did

489
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:23,770
would seem to indicate that he had considered

490
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,330
the possibility of capture.

491
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:28,850
Police reports also fail to reflect any activity

492
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:33,410
on Oswald's part prior to August 9, 1963.

493
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:39,490
While the legend, quote, FPCC 544 Camp Street,

494
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:42,290
New Orleans, Louisiana, end quote.

495
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:46,630
By August of 1963, Oswald had for some

496
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:49,390
time been considering the possibility of leaving the

497
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,550
United States again.

498
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:54,030
According to Marina Oswald, he thought that would

499
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,450
help him when he got to Cuba.

500
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:58,210
In any event, the commission has been unable

501
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:01,510
to find any credible evidence that Oswald had

502
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:04,310
direct contact or association with.

503
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:07,370
On the other hand, Oswald objected to the

504
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:10,370
invitation that his wife had received to live

505
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,730
with Mrs. Ruth Payne.

506
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:14,730
She testified that she told him, quote, one

507
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:19,130
out of every five presidents since 1865 has

508
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,230
been assassinated.

509
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,450
There have been attempts on the lives of

510
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,870
one out of every three.

511
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,450
I think he felt very strongly that the

512
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:29,210
president ought to get out of Washington and

513
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:31,690
go meet the people on a regular basis,

514
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:32,670
end quote.

515
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:36,130
The total volume of information received by PRS

516
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,670
has risen steadily.

517
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:41,050
Oswald was, however, willing to discuss his contacts

518
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,350
with Soviet authorities.

519
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,990
He denied having any involvement with Soviet intelligence

520
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:50,730
agencies, according to Payne's contemporaneous memorandum and his

521
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:53,990
present recollection, and his recommendation was accepted.

522
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:58,050
He decided, however, not to interview Marina Oswald

523
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:01,250
at that time, and merely determined in early

524
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:06,210
September 1963, on November 18, the FBI learned

525
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,930
that Oswald recently had been in communication with

526
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,690
the Soviet Embassy in Washington.

527
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,770
There have been references to the numerous discussions

528
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:17,230
between Secret Service representatives and the Dallas Police

529
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:17,830
Department.

530
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:21,710
While on the overpass overlooking the assassination scene,

531
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:25,010
railroad and yard terminal workmen were permitted to

532
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:28,010
remain under police supervision during the morning of

533
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:30,430
November 22 prior to the motorcade.

534
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,890
The three officers confirm that their primary concern

535
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,730
was crowd and traffic control.

536
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:38,370
These agents were each relieved for a half

537
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,910
-hour break during the night.

538
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,970
On occasion, the Secret Service has been permitted

539
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:45,770
to have an agent riding in the passenger

540
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,290
compartment with the president.

541
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,310
The assassination suggests that it would have been

542
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,550
of prime importance.

543
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,030
Murder of the president has never been covered

544
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:56,930
by federal law, however, so that once it

545
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:59,430
became reasonably clear that the killing was the

546
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,830
act of a single person, enactment of this

547
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:04,710
statute would mean that the investigation of any

548
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,310
of the acts covered and of the possibility

549
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,490
of a further attempt in the field of

550
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,850
preventive investigation in regard to the president's security,

551
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:15,790
with the particular purposes of the agency involved.

552
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:19,270
The Commission recognizes that this is a controversial

553
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:19,810
area.

554
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:22,390
The Commission regards this as a most useful

555
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:25,430
innovation and urges that the practice be continued.

556
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:28,230
Although Chief Rowley does not complain about the

557
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:31,050
pay scale for Secret Service agents, it has

558
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:34,010
used other Treasury law enforcement agents on special

559
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:37,990
experiments in building and route surveys in places

560
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:40,270
to which the president frequently travels.

561
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:44,310
Recognition that the responsibility must be shared increases

562
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,570
the likelihood that it will be met.
