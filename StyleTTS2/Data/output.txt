output_1.wav|Even the Kaslan type, when enlarged, shows great|1
output_2.wav|shortcomings in this respect.|1
output_3.wav|For where these are boldly and carefully designed,|1
output_4.wav|and each letter is thoroughly individual in form,|1
output_5.wav|the due relation of letter to pictures and|1
output_6.wav|other ornament was thoroughly understood by the old|1
output_7.wav|printers.|1
output_8.wav|So that of these wards, three were appropriated|1
output_9.wav|to the cabin side, so called, because the|1
output_10.wav|provisions were on that side of the boat|1
output_11.wav|where the cabin would have been in the|1
output_12.wav|steamboat.|1
output_13.wav|This law had the effect, it was hoped,|1
output_14.wav|of putting a stop to the system of intimidation|1
output_15.wav|then prevailing in many parts of the country,|1
output_16.wav|where a number of persons would wait at the|1
output_17.wav|poll and challenge the vote of any person|1
output_18.wav|whom they considered to be likely to vote|1
output_19.wav|against their particular candidate.|1
output_20.wav|A man by the name of John Thomas, of a parish|1
output_21.wav|that I will not name, was brought into the|1
output_22.wav|court on a charge of having used intimidation.|1
output_23.wav|The question was whether there was sufficient evidence|1
output_24.wav|to go to the jury that a person had been|1
output_25.wav|intimidated by his conduct.|1
output_26.wav|It was proved that the man was the most|1
output_27.wav|popular man in the parish, that he was the|1
output_28.wav|president of a club, and that the club had|1
output_29.wav|made a resolution that any member of the club|1
output_30.wav|who voted for a certain candidate would be expelled.|1
output_31.wav|The defendant had a good character and had been|1
output_32.wav|a leading man in the parish, and the court|1
output_33.wav|held that there was not sufficient evidence to go|1
output_34.wav|to the jury that the man had used intimidation.|1
output_35.wav|The whole thing was a failure, and it was|1
output_36.wav|not very long after that that the law was|1
output_37.wav|amended, and a provision was inserted that any|1
output_38.wav|person who used intimidation, either directly or indirectly,|1
output_39.wav|should be liable to imprisonment or to a fine.|1
output_40.wav|The next case that I will name is a case|1
output_41.wav|of a man who was tried for having stolen a|1
output_42.wav|sheep.|1
output_43.wav|He was brought into the court, and the judge|1
output_44.wav|said to him, "You are charged with having stolen|1
output_45.wav|a sheep, and the evidence is that you were|1
output_46.wav|seen at the place where the sheep was stolen,|1
output_47.wav|and that you had a bag with you, and that|1
